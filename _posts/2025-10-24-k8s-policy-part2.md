In [Part 1](https://securitywithzee.com/posts/k8s-policy-part1/) of this series, we deployed the VULN-BANK application to Kubernetes and enforced Pod Security Standards using Kyverno ensuring that all containers ran as non-root users and that default CPU and memory limits were automatically injected when not defined. Now, in Part 2, we'll take Kubernetes policy enforcement a step further by implementing OPA Gatekeeper.

While Kyverno focuses on policy management using simple Kubernetes-native YAML syntax, OPA Gatekeeper allows for more advanced, logic-driven policies using the Rego policy language which is ideal for compliance-heavy or logic-based restrictions.

## What We'll Cover

In this section, we'll:

- Install and configure OPA Gatekeeper in our cluster
- Define a ConstraintTemplate and Constraint to block Pods that use `hostNetwork: true` or run in privileged mode
- Test and validate our policies to ensure the cluster rejects insecure configurations
- Test GitHub Actions to check policies on PRs

**Use Case**: Block Pods from Using Host Networking and Privileged Mode.

**Scenario**: As a security professional, we want to prevent applications deployed by the development team from using `hostNetwork: true` or running in privileged mode due to compliance with regulatory frameworks (e.g., PCI DSS or ISO 27001).

## OPA Gatekeeper Implementation â€“ Installation, Policy and Testing

Let's begin by setting up OPA Gatekeeper.

### Step 1: Install Gatekeeper via Helm

```bash
helm repo add gatekeeper https://open-policy-agent.github.io/gatekeeper/charts
helm repo update
helm install gatekeeper gatekeeper/gatekeeper --namespace gatekeeper-system --create-namespace
```

**Verify Gatekeeper pods:**

```bash
kubectl get pods -n gatekeeper-system -w
```

![Gatekeeper pods](/assets/img/opa/2.png)

Gatekeeper ConstraintTemplates are written in Rego, packaged as CRDs and instantiated through Constraints. A ConstraintTemplate defines the policy logic. So, we'll create a ConstraintTemplate and a Constraint in the next step.

### Step 2: Create a Gatekeeper ConstraintTemplate

Create `policies/gatekeeper/templates/block-hostnet-privileged.template.yaml`:

The file content can be found here: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/zainaboladiti/cloud-security-k8s-policy)

### Step 3: Apply Gatekeeper Constraint (to Enforce the Template)

A Constraint is an instance of a template that specifies where the policy should be enforced.

Create `policies/gatekeeper/constraints/block-hostnet-privileged.constraint.yaml`:

The file content can be found here: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/zainaboladiti/cloud-security-k8s-policy)

This ensures the Template is applied to Pod and common workload types (Gatekeeper evaluates the pod template inside workloads).

**Apply OPA Gatekeeper Templates and Constraints:**

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s-policies/gatekeeper/templates/block-hostnet-privileged.template.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s-policies/gatekeeper/constraints/block-hostnet-privileged.constraint.yaml
```

## Testing and Verification

### Test hostNetwork:true

In project folder create `k8s/bad-hostnet.yaml` Pod, a Pod manifest to violate `hostNetwork: true`

The file content can be found here: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/zainaboladiti/cloud-security-k8s-policy)

Apply the pod manifest, it's expected for the Gatekeeper to block it:

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/bad-hostnet.yaml
```

### Test Privileged Container

Create a test Pod `k8s/bad-privileged.yaml` that violates privileged containers policy.

The file content can be found here: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/zainaboladiti/cloud-security-k8s-policy)

Apply the pod manifest, it's expected Gatekeeper will block this as well:

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/bad-privileged.yaml
```

> **Tip**: Gatekeeper has a local testing tool called `gator` that lets you validate templates and constraints offline before applying to a cluster, which is very handy in CI.

## Why These Policies Matter

- When `hostNetwork` is enabled, a Pod shares the host's network namespace, this gives the Pod potential access to all host interfaces, ports and traffic, breaking network isolation.
- Running a container in privileged mode gives it near-root access to the host, allowing kernel interactions and system modifications. Attackers could use this to escape the container or tamper with the host OS.
- Regulatory standards like PCI DSS strictly prohibit this level of exposure. Denying privileged mode ensures compliance and prevents privilege escalation vectors.

Together, these Gatekeeper constraints fortify cluster boundaries, uphold compliance and ensure that only safe workloads are admitted thereby protecting both applications and infrastructure.

## CI: GitHub Actions to Check Policies on PRs

We'd use Kyverno test action to validate YAMLs/Helm charts against policies during PRs. To do this, we'd set up two workflows in `.github/workflows`:

### Kyverno Policy Check (Runs Kyverno Checks on Manifests)

In .github folder, create `.github/workflows/kyverno-ci.yml`

The file content can be found here: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/zainaboladiti/cloud-security-k8s-policy)

We'll test for both manifests that don't comply to the policies as well as test the compliant manifests.

<!-- ### Gatekeeper CI Policy Check Using Gator

In .github folder, create `.github/workflows/gatekeeper-ci.yml`

The file content can be found here: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/zainaboladiti/cloud-security-k8s-policy)

`gator test` will run the templates + constraints against the manifest samples included in the repo and exit non-zero if violations exist. This is useful to prevent policy violations in PRs.

![Gatekeeper CI workflow](path/to/image27.png)

The GitHub Actions workflow validates the Kubernetes security policies (Kyverno and OPA Gatekeeper). A successful run means the policy definitions are syntactically correct and ready for enforcement in the cluster.

A failed run can also be intentional as it demonstrates that the CI pipeline correctly identifies insecure configurations (such as privileged containers or missing resource limits) and prevents them from being merged, enforcing compliance automatically. -->

## Conclusion

In this two-part series, we've implemented a comprehensive Policy-as-Code solution for Kubernetes using both Kyverno and OPA Gatekeeper. We've:

- Deployed a vulnerable application (VULN-BANK) in a local Kubernetes cluster
- Enforced security best practices using Kyverno (non-root containers, resource limits)
- Implemented compliance-focused policies using OPA Gatekeeper (blocking hostNetwork and privileged mode)
- Integrated policy validation into CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions

This approach ensures that security and compliance are built into the development lifecycle, reducing human error and automatically enforcing organisational standards before workloads reach production.
