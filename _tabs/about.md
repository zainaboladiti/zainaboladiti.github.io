# ðŸ‘‹ Hi!, Meet the Analyst Behind SecurityWithZee
 
I'm Zainab (or simply 'Zee'), and this site is my technical journal dedicated to the art and science of securing the digital landscape.

I am a **Cybersecurity Analyst** with background in software development and deep-seated commitment to the **DevSecOps** philosophy believing that security isn't a checklist at the end, but an integral, invisible layer woven into the development process. Like many in this field, I'm a curious engineer at heart, driven by a passion for building, and most importantly, **defending** the systems that power our world.

This site is my way of journaling my journey and **contributing to collective growth** as I firmly believe in sharing my learnings to industry peers and the wider community.

### What to Expect on This Journey

This journal offers a practical, hands-on look at the daily and strategic challenges of modern application and cloud security. You can expect content spanning my personal and professional interests:

* **Secure Development & DevSecOps:** Embedding security practices into the pipeline.
* **Cloud and Application Security:** Architecting protection for modern, scaled environments.
* **Vulnerability Management & Threat Hunting:** Practical deep dives into discovery, analysis and proactive defense.
* **Incident Response:** Navigating complex security events and extracting critical lessons.

If you are invested in **building secure code** or mastering the tools to **defend robust systems**, you are in the right place.

**Let's build secure solutions, share knowledge and grow together.**
