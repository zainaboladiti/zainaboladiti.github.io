# 👋 Hi!, Meet the Analyst Behind SecurityWithZee

I’m Zainab (or simply ‘Zee’), and this site is my technical journal dedicated to the art and science of securing the digital landscape.

I am a Cybersecurity Analyst with background in software development and deep-seated commitment to the DevSecOps philosophy believing that security isn’t a checklist at the end, but an integral, invisible layer woven into the development process. Like many in this field, I’m a curious engineer at heart, driven by a passion for building, and most importantly, defending the systems that power our world.

This site is my way of journaling my journey and contributing to collective growth as I firmly believe in sharing my learnings to industry peers and the wider community.
